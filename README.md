text## 🔄 Continuous Integration & Deployment

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** with a custom workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

- Every push to `main` is automatically validated (HTML syntax check + required files)
- If validation passes → the website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- If validation fails → deployment is rejected and a clear error message is shown
- Your professor can push changes directly and they will go live automatically (if valid)

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- Clean Tokyo-inspired minimal aesthetic
- Consistent dark navbar across all pages
- Beautiful profile cards with hover animations
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout

## 👥 Team Members (Demo Data)

- **MOISES FERRERA** 
- **ROMEL SANTOS**
- **BENJAMIN ZARI**
- **ANGELO AREVALO** 

*(Easy to replace with real names and photos in `main.js`)*
